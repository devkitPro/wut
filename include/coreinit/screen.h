 * <!-- quick blurb - may show up on Modules page -->
 * Software-rendered graphics system, suitable for text output and simple
 * graphics.
 *
 * OSScreen is much more straightforward than GX2, which makes it appealing for
 * situations that do not require complex graphics. It can draw text and pixels
 * (one at a time!) to both the Gamepad and TV.
 *
 * To use OSScreen, first call \link OSScreenInit \endlink. Then, allocate a
 * memory area and pass it to OSScreen with \link OSScreenSetBufferEx \endlink -
 * after enabling the screens with \link OSScreenEnableEx \endlink, the library
 * will be ready to draw! Drawing is accomplished with \link
 * OSScreenClearBufferEx \endlink, \link OSScreenPutFontEx \endlink and \link
 * OSScreenPutPixelEx \endlink. Once drawing is complete, call \link
 * OSScreenFlipBuffersEx \endlink to show the results on-screen. Rinse and
 * repeat!
 *
 * <!-- Documentation meta: OSScreen has a weird naming convention, especially
 *      around the word "buffer". So, here's what we're doing:
 *      - A single framebuffer is a "buffer".
 *      - The framebuffer that is visible is the "visible buffer" while the one
 *        being drawn to is the "work buffer"
 *      - The pointers going to OSScreenSetBufferEx are not buffers. Try "memory
 *        area", "location", whatever.
 *      - A "screen" refers to the Gamepad or TV.
 *      - Members of OSScreenID are not buffers. Try "screen ID".
 *      This should help prevent confusion. If you change this, make sure to
 *      update all the docs to keep everything consistent. -->
