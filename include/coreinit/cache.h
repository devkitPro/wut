/**
 * \defgroup coreinit_cache Cache
 * \ingroup coreinit
 *
 * Interface to the low-level caching system of the PowerPC processor.
 *
 * The cache acts as a middleman between main
 * memory and the processor, speeding up access to frequently-used data.
 * However, the Wii U is not cache-coherent - written data may be cached
 * without updating main memory, and data read from the cache may be out of date
 * with respect to memory. While this isn't a problem for most code, certain
 * hardware accesses may require manual synchronisation of the cache. This is
 * achieved with coreinit's Cache group of functions.
 *
 * Since the PowerPC has a seperate cache for data and instructions, any data
 * written with the intent of executing it as instructions requires manual
 * flushing and invalidation of the data and instruction caches.
